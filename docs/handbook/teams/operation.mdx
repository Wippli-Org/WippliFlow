### Workflow

We use Pylon as our centralized hub to collect and manage all incoming requests from multiple channels:

- Pylon (via Slack, Email)
- GitHub Issues
- Discord Community
- Internal Requests
- Feature Base

All issues are triaged and routed to the appropriate team for resolution.

## Issue Triaging

We follow specific criteria to determine the priority of each task based on the team it belongs to.
